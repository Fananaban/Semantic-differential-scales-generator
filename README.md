# Semantic Differential Scales Generator
This is a python script designed to generate semantic differential scales for material analysis.
It will generate a series of graphs based on user inputs to represent materials and their percieved properties.



## Using the script
Just open the script in whatever python editor you use, run it, and follow the instructions in the terminal.
When you run the script you will be asked a series of questions:
These will include asking you to name all your materials, name all your properties, and name values for the average and standard deviation of each material/property combination

If you are feeling particularly lazy, you can just generate totally random values for the data.

You can also add slight amounts of randomness to save time and make plain integers more interesting.
